## WE UPDATED THE GAME

Ye so, despite being on the grindset mindset and finishing our work last night we're pushing more updates! We might push more depending on if/when bugs occur, but all the stuff that's been changed is listed here.

## CHANGELOG
`v1.0.5`
- **GF size fixed**. I screwed up what I needed to make bigger and what needed to stay the same.
- **DD left/right poses fixed**, now he's singing the right way.
- **Custom font used throughout the entire game**. By the way, the font is called Upheaval Pro Regular, check out the font [here](https://www.1001fonts.com/upheaval-pro-font.html)!
- **Button indicators/clickable links are now the only texts in white**.
- **Various menu touchups**.
- **Game Over menu now displays more detailed stats**. Things like the combo breaks and the amount hit in each rating is displayed.
- **Fixed S rating score**. We noticed DD people couldn't get up to the 410000 previous S-rank score, so we did y'all a favor. If you hit this new S-tier rating, *you will have the medal manually unlocked, so no worries about re-beating for that score*. Shoutout to [gamercat48](http://gamercat48.newgrounds.com/) for being the current only person to hit the new 400000-point S-rating on DD!
- **Fixed custom font not always appearing**. Preloading does help a good bit.
- We listened to you guys - lemme make this loud and proud...

## Ratings are now underneath the arrows!
Insert is da MVP, and your eyesight is back.

For now, this'll be the last update of the game. However, there's other things we may add at a later date, which may include the following:
- **1-5% addition to score for every 10 on the current combo** *(in other words, if you hit a note when your combo is 10 you get the rating score plus 1-5% of that score, when combo is 20 you get rating score plus 2-10%, etc.)*. We may lean to do a percentage closer to 1% if we go through with this, but it could help get higher scores and a greater ability to reach S rankings.
- **More funnies**. We added one for the pause menu, but *I crave funnies*, particularly those that are attached to Tankmas/NG overall. If you have a funny to suggest, send it to me!
- **Pause menu music**. I've been debating on what to use for it, since I wanna stick to using Tankmas music in this game. If you have a suggestion (that isn't used already in game or in the mashup), let me know!

Overall, I had a blast coding this in. It was my first time really handling Haxe code (I did touch code for Tankmas in 2021, but mainly to help with present/content load-in), and I had a really fun time doing so! I learned a good bit, and honestly there's things I want to do that just wouldn't fit into this game. But hey, I'm excited to experiment some more, not just with FNF but perhaps with other games too. That's right, I'm sliding down the game dev pipeline LOL
