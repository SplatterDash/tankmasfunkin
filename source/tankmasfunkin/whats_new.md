## WE UPDATED THE GAME

Ye so, despite being on the grindset mindset and finishing our work last night we're pushing more updates! We might push more depending on if/when bugs occur, but all the stuff that's been changed is listed here.

## CHANGELOG
`v1.0.7`
- **Added some funnies.** You're welcome.
- **Added pause menu music.** I left this up to the request of my team, but the pause music comes from Advent 2022, so that works out! Check it out [here](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1181001).
- **Added new medal.** All you have to do is log into the game, and then boom, you get the medal. Speaking of medals, has anyone clicked around the controls menu?
- **Added time bar.** Unlike a bunch of code, this bar was homemade and baked fresh! Now you can see how long you have left on the song until you get to the end.
- **Added new UI options.** We added some things you might see in other FNF works, such as middlescroll, downscroll, fullscreen, and the ability to toggle the new time bar and score text.
- **Added note splashes.** Every time you get a sweet, you also get a fancy note splash!
- **Added practice mode.** Practice mode turns off ghost taps at the expense of your scores not saving at the end. I know there's a lot of works that save scores with ghost taps on, but honestly having that be a good tradeoff in place of health is something I think works.
- **Added botplay.** Y'know, if you just wanna see it and not play it... lazy. If you play till the end and hit the restart button, botplay will automatically get turned off.
- **Added ability to return to main menu on pause screen.** In case you wanna change settings or whatnot!
- **Fixed BF sprite.** There were some problems with that, so we needed to go in and fix it up a bit.
- **Nerfed scoring.** For every 10 you hit on the combo meter, your score will now have an additional 1% added onto it. This should help in getting some S-tier rankings, especially as DD! Adjustments to the scores and the scoring windows have also been tweaked - now you'll see the Grinchy ratings while still having a good opportunity for Sweets!
- **Updated game over screen.** Now, before you see your final score, you can see how many of each rating you got and how many misses you had, in case you're curious!
- **Options now save when you set them in the options menu.** This includes all new UI options, custom keybinds, and volume settings. Now you don't have to reset them every time you want to play!


`v1.0.5`
- **GF size fixed**. I screwed up what I needed to make bigger and what needed to stay the same.
- **DD left/right poses fixed**, now he's singing the right way.
- **Custom font used throughout the entire game**. By the way, the font is called Upheaval Pro Regular, check out the font [here](https://www.1001fonts.com/upheaval-pro-font.html)!
- **Button indicators/clickable links are now the only texts in white**.
- **Various menu touchups**.
- **Game Over menu now displays more detailed stats**. Things like the combo breaks and the amount hit in each rating is displayed.
- **Fixed S rating score**. We noticed DD people couldn't get up to the 410000 previous S-rank score, so we did y'all a favor. If you hit this new S-tier rating, *you will have the medal manually unlocked, so no worries about re-beating for that score*. Shoutout to [gamercat48](http://gamercat48.newgrounds.com/) for being the current only person to hit the new 400000-point S-rating on DD!
- **Fixed custom font not always appearing**. Preloading does help a good bit.
- We listened to you guys - lemme make this loud and proud...

## Ratings are now underneath the arrows!
Insert is da MVP, and your eyesight is back.

I now write this as I finish what my team and I decided would be the final update to the game. Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed working with this, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't still queasy about this being on NG. I recognize just how much of a tightrope this walks, and honestly I'd rather not walk it again. Yes, I had a blast coding this in, and yes it was my first time really handling Haxe code (I did touch code for Tankmas in 2021, but mainly to help with present/content load-in), and I had a really fun time doing so. Yes, I learned a good bit, and honestly there's things I want to do that just wouldn't fit into this game. And I'm still excited to experiment some more, not just with FNF but perhaps with other game ideas and concepts too. But I'm still worried that this is a seed to a horribly bad oak by placing it on NG. Honestly, the reason why this update took so long after the original posting is because I put my time and attention on things that I feel won't turn out to be these kinds of bad oaks.

When I had a lot of discussions starting in early January about placing this on NG, I was worried even from then because of the rules and because of what happens with the community. This wasn't supposed to be a mod, but we ran out of time to implement it as a quality minigame on the Tankmas calendar. I felt it wasn't right to place it on GameBanana or GameJolt because it was too... empty, I guess is the best word to describe it. That, and the audience that would enjoy and appreciate it wouldn't be on GB or GJ; it'd be on *Newgrounds*, where the Tankmas tradition is held. At its heart I still agree and say, no matter how many times I denied it to Brandy at first, this is a mod because of the core gameplay elements - the *defining feature of FNF* - remaining the same. But is it subject to the same judgment as other skin-swapper games, the things I was told from someone that the NG community would overlook? And would other people see it's different?

I don't know, I'm still worried about my choice because of what it could lead to. We released it for Pixel Day because we wanted to cusion the blow and hopefully not set a bad precedent, but if this ends up creating a bad oak and the NG Game Portal is clogged with mods, then I'm really sorry. I don't mean to push this mod with bad intentions towards NG or the Game Portal, and nobody on my team does either.

I will say this mod has done its job though. I *want* to experiment with what HaxeFlixel can do, and if I do get the opportunity to code for another mod a) I don't want to post it to NG, and b) I want to experiment more, especially with this fusion of a system I have. I don't want to make an *engine* outta this, maybe a template to expand upon sure, but I *want* to push the limits of what an FNF mod can be - not just in the look and style, but in gameplay too. With the system I have in my hands, I might be able to take it and have different gameplay elements mapped to the same keys as the base game, swapping from a rhythm game to platformer on the turn of a dime, or even something where you'd have to move to get out of a struggle. I'm still thinking on it, but I have a good base to expand upon with this and, honestly, I might try to create a unique game in the future.

And why stop there? I won't get anywhere if I keep sucking the teet of a game I enjoy, even if it is a game I enjoy - I'll get somewhere if I push myself to be creative. I *love* telling stories, especially in music, and I think I want to do something of that nature, where every element plays into the story. Heck, if I could do something that's visual novel-esque where there's no dialogue and the story is told through the gameplay choices you make and the visuals you see, I would have a blast creating it. I know I absoultely suck at art, but that doesn't matter to me. What matters is my passion and want to create something interesting, experimental, and special to me.

I stayed in the FNF community - and still do - because of the music I make. I still stand by the fact that I want to make works of passion as a hobby, not to have this be my main job and a chore. But I think working with this mod's coding made me wanna keep learning more and pushing HaxeFlixel to its limits. I want to do things that tell interesting stories and can be experimental, and I think what I have here is a springboard to do that.

Am I weary of posting to NG? Absolutely. But do I regret the time I spent coding this mod? Absolutely not. It gave me a way to be creative, and keep being creative, in a fresh and unique light.

Hopefully I'll see y'all around, wherever you may be - on NG, in FNF, or beyond.
