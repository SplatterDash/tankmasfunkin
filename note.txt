Happy New Year!\n
This year's Tankmas marked the fifth\n
Tankmas since it became a tradition\n
in 2018 and the tenth anniversary\n
of the first NG Advent Calendars in\n
2012!\n
To celebrate these milestones, and\n
as an ode to the man who led the\n
first tradition calendar, ninjamuffin,\n
enjoy this FNF-style minigame featuring\n
an eight-minute mashup of songs from\n
all Advent Calendars 2012-2022!\n\n

Merry Tankmas and Cheers to 2023,\n
~Tankmas Funkin crew\n\n

P.S. There's no health system in-game,\n
and there's no way to lose, so go for\n
the best score you can!
