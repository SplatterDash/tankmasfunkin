## Yeah we're late but who's keeping track, it's TANKMAS

Happy Pixel Day!

In celebration of the day, we wanted to release a little pixel gift of ours. Originally created for Tankmas 2022 but unable to be completed before that wrapped up, this is our way of celebrating the NG tradition!

## Why Tankmas?

In case you didn't know, this past Tankmas (2022) was the mark of two occasions related to Tankmas. It marked the fifth Tankmas since it became a tradition in 2017, and it marked the tenth anniversary of the first NG Advent Calendar, or calendars, back in 2012!

This was intended to be a minigame within Tankmas 2022, as a way of celebrating those two occasions and as an ode to the person who started the tradition back in 2017, ninjamuffin (yes, THAT ninjamuffin!). What better way to do that than to revive an idea that the team had in 2020 - an FNF-inspired rhythm game utilizing a mashup of Tankmas songs from the past five years! (A song each from the first two calendars are also on each menu, so our bases are covered!)

Because it was aimed to appear in Tankmas 2022, this project utilized the format that minigames for that specific calendar needed to have. This varied quite a bit from the systems the original FNF uses, but it gives it a unique flare too!

Speaking of unique - the minigame also utilizes unique features in the vibe of a Tankmas minigame. No health mechanics, simpler menus and a UI changeup were all included. The only elements that tie it to being an FNF "mod" is the main game elements and a few carried SFX (countdown/miss SFX to be specific).

Knowing this, I took the time to talk to folks on the Game Portal moderation team, and we've gotten permission to post this for Pixel Day. Under a normal circumstance, *a mod of any game would not be allowed on the portal.* Throwing it out there.

If you wanna mosey around the code, I placed some comments and things as commentary of sorts. It's
messy because this is my first time working code independently in Haxe, but hopefully it gives you
some ideas!

This game was built from the ground up using the original Friday Night Funkin source code instead of an engine. That source code can be found [here](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin).
